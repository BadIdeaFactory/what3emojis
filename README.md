# what3emojis

what3emojis is a revolutionary new way of addressing the entire world using the only common language of the entire human race, _emoji_.

:princess: :smile_cat: :man_with_gua_pi_mao:

Why _emoji_? Because current ways of addressing places can cause all sorts of dangerous miscommunications, sometime resulting in gigantic wars. Street addresses, for example, are long and convoluted and prone to error. Place names are ambiguous and disputed by different stakeholders. Numerical values like latitude-longitude coordinates are hard to remember. You could do much better with three totally random English words, but what about non-English speakers? No system for standardized addressing is perfect.

That's why _emoji_.

_Emoji_ are universally recognized symbols for nearly all of human thought and emotion and this is why nine of ten expert scientists predict that _emoji_ will become the dominant, if not sole language for all humanity by the year 2075. _Emoji_ are easy to type, understand, and completely unambiguous in meaning with zero controversies. The Unicode Consortium is constantly evaluating cultural trends for _emoji_ candidates and adding millions of new _emoji_ every year to accurately index human communication. This makes it the ideal way to address arbitrary locations around the world.

## How it works

:interrobang: :postal_horn: :crystal_ball:

Every location on Earth is divided into 4m x 4m x 4m Dymaxion triangles and randomly assigned a unique three-_emoji_ combination using our state-of-the-art patented random-_emoji_-assigning algorithm. You can explore the map to discover what _emoji_ is assigned to your spot on the planet, or search by a particular address. With this _emoji_, you can send this to your friends, family and peers around the world and instantly communicate a precise and unambiguous location!

If you are unhappy with the _emoji_ you are assigned you can reserve custom _emoji_ markers for your triangle for only a low, lifetime price of $24.99.* Custom _emoji_ can be any length (except three), up to the `VARCHAR` limit set in our MySQL database.

We are actively working with all map and geocoding vendors including local, state and federal governments worldwide to make sure that your _emoji_ address is recognized legally everywhere. This means you can mail packages by sending them to your _emoji_ address!*
